# Whirlwind Docs.

This folder contains (sparse) notes to get up to speed in aiding Whirlwind's development process. It is mostly geared towards people who either wish to contribute to this repository, or gain a deeper understanding of the language's concepts.

If you are just looking to learn how to write programs in Whirlwind, a better place to start would be the site, [here](http://whirlwind.lang.vercel.app).

_Every single file in this folder is subject to change. Nothing here is law, there are only excuses and explanations._
