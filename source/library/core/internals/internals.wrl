/// ## Core of the Core.
/// This module is the beating heart of Whirlwind, responsible for defining and orchestrating
/// critical low-level functions and data manipulations.
/// 
/// It is **strictly** for internal core library development and optimization
/// purposes. Treat everything within it as unsafe, unstable and unpredictable, unless
/// stated otherwise. Modifying its contents or directly depending on them 
/// _will_ have unintended consequences.
/// 
/// If you break anything, it's not my fault.
