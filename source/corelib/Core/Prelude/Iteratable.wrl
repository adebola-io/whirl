/// ## The Iteratable interface
/// The Iteratable interface is a common abstraction that allows different types of collections to be traversed in a uniform way. 
/// It defines a set of methods that can be used to access and manipulate the elements of a collection, such as arrays, lists, sets, maps, etc.
///
/// It is usually specified as a generic parameter or an associated type. 
/// The `Next()` method is the core method that moves the iterator forward and returns the next element, 
/// or `None` if there are no more elements. 
/// 
/// The Iteratable interface also provides many other methods that are implemented based on the next method. 
/// These methods can perform various operations on the elements of the iterator, 
/// such as filtering, mapping, folding, counting, etc.
///  
/// Some of these methods consume the iterator and return a single value, 
/// while others return another iterator that can be chained with further methods.
/// The Iteratable interface can be implemented for any type that represents a sequence of values. 
/// 
/// Optionally, one can also override some of the default methods to provide more efficient or customized behavior.
public interface Iteratable<I> {
    /// Returns the next item in the iteration.
    public function Next(): Maybe<I>;

    /// ### Usage
    /// ```
    /// ```

        Todo()

    /// 
    /// The method is shortcircuiting, therefore if there are elements left 
    /// after the target element is found, the iterator can still be used.
    /// ### Usage
    /// ```
    /// iterator := [11, 12, 13, 14, 15].IntoIter();
    /// 
    /// AssertThat(iterator.Any(fn(x) x % 2 == 0)); // Returns true at 12.
    /// // Iterator can still be used.
    /// Assert(iterator.Next()).Equals(Some(13));
    /// Assert(iterator.Next()).Equals(Some(14));
