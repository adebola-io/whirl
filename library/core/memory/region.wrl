/// ## Regions and Deterministic Memory Management.
/// A memory region is a defined scope for confining the lifetimes of heap allocated
/// data.
///
/// Regions provide explicit control over memory allocation and deallocation within their
/// boundaries. Objects created in the scope of a region are considered local to that region
/// and automatically freed when the region is destroyed. This approach should simplify
/// memory management compared to manual creation and deletion.
/// 
/// Internally regions are stacked on top of each other, meaning that the newest created region
/// is the current region in use, and that regions can be nested within each other.
/// 
/// A region has a list of methods for interacting directly with data within it, such as:
/// - prematurely freeing data that is no longer in use,
/// - pinning data so that it can outlive the current region.
/// - capturing data from parent region scopes, etc.
public model Region {
    /// Moves an object instance from the current region to a parent region,
    /// basically extending its lifetime, and ensuring that it is not deallocated when
    /// the current region is destroyed.
    /// 
    /// ### Usage
    /// ```
    /// r := Region.create();
    /// array := [1, 2, 3]; // Created in region r.
    /// r.pin(array);
    /// 
    /// r.destroy();
    /// print(array[1]); // Still valid, because array is no longer owned by region r.
    /// ```
    /// The method is recursive, meaning that pinning an object will also pin all
    /// its internal values and attributes.
    /// ```
    /// r2 := Region.create();
    /// 
    /// name := "Michael"; // Created inside region r.
    /// nameList := [name]; // Created inside region r.
    /// 
    /// r2.pin(nameList);
    /// r2.destroy();
    /// 
    /// print(nameList); // Valid because nameList is pinned.
    /// print(name); // Valid because name is an item in nameList, inheriting its pinned state.
