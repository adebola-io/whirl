<h1 align=center>Ideas for Whirlwind.</h1>

This branch is for new ideas for the Whirlwind language, be it syntactic, semantic or structural. It is dedicated to the design of new concepts to add to Whirlwind.

## How to Contribute.

If you want to add to the Whirlwind language:

-  Create a new file in the `proposals` folder with a specification explaining the new feature you want. For example, if you want Whirlwind to have list comprehensions like Python, you create a file called `list-comprehensions.md`.
-  Create an accompanying issue with the tags `whiteboard` and `proposal`.
-  Within the file, explain in detail the way in which this feature would improve the language and how it would work.
-  _Be as detailed as possible_. Include code snippets, examples, possible constraints or drawbacks, etc.
-  Ensure that the feature is not already being considered. Duplicate features will be ignored.

Each feature will move up from the `proposals` folder to:

-  the `current` folder when it is being considered,
-  the `approved` folder once it has been understood and approved, and then
-  the `final` folder when it is finally implemented in the language.

Feel free to let us know your most interesting ideas! âœ¨
