# Whirlwind.

Whirlwind is a simple programming language for quickly and easily writing maintenable software.

## Features

-  First Class Functions.
-  Static Typing System.
-  Generics and Polymorphism.
-  Inbuilt Testing capabilities.
-  Support for modules.

## Syntax

Whirlwind is inspired heavily by the syntax of languages like Rust and Typescript. An example of Whirlwind code would be:

```ts
function Add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
   return a + b;
}

function Main() {
   var c = Add(2, 3);
   Core.Io.Println(c);
}
```
