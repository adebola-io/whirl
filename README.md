<h1 align=center>Whirl üê∫</h1>

Whirl is a simple, interpreted programming language for quickly and easily writing maintenable software.

## Features

-  Objects.
-  First Class Functions.
-  Static Typing System.
-  Generics and Polymorphism.
-  Inbuilt Testing capabilities.
-  Support for modules.

## Syntax

Whirl is inspired heavily by the syntax of languages like Rust and Typescript. An example of Whirl code would be:

```ts
function Add(a: Int, b: Int): Int
{
  a + b
}

function Main() 
{
  c := Add(2, 3);
  Core.Io.Println(c);
}
```
