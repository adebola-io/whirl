</h1>

Whirlwind is an open-source, statically-typed programming language for quickly and easily writing maintenable software. It is designed to be practical, easy to read and efficient.

## Documentation üìë

The [Whirlwind website](http://whirlwind-lang.vercel.app) is still pending. For more information relating to the source code, refer to the [docs](https://github.com/adebola-io/whirlwind/tree/master/docs) folder.

## Features ‚ú®

-  First Class Functions.
-  Static, Nominal Typing System.
-  Support for Generic Programming.
-  Support for Union Types.
-  Inbuilt Testing capabilities. (todo)
-  Modular organization.

## Syntax üìê

Whirlwind is inspired heavily by the syntax of already existing languages. An example of Whirlwind code is:

```rs
use system.io.print

/// Function to add two numbers.
function add(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
   return a + b
}

/// Entry to the program.
function main {
   c := add(2, 3)
   print(c)
}
```
