Whirlwind is an open-source, statically-typed programming language for quickly and easily writing maintenable software. It is designed to be practical, easy to read and efficient.

## Documentation

For more information about installing, using and understanding Whirlwind, check out the [Whirlwind website](http://whirlwind-lang.vercel.app).

For more information relating to the source code, refer to the [docs](./docs/README.md) folder.

## Features

-  First Class Functions.
-  Static, Nominal Typing System.
-  Support for Generic Programming and Union Types.
-  Inbuilt Testing capabilities.
-  Modular organization.

## Syntax

Whirlwind is inspired heavily by the syntax of already existing languages. An example of Whirlwind code is:

```typescript
/// Function to add two numbers.
function Add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
   return a + b;
}

/// Entry to the program.
function main() {
   c := Add(2, 3);
   core.io.Println(c);
}
```
