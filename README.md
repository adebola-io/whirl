Whirlwind is an open-source, statically-typed programming language for quickly and easily writing maintainable software. It is designed to be practical, easy to read and efficient.

## Documentation üìë

The [Whirlwind website](http://whirlwind-lang.vercel.app) is still pending. For more information relating to the source code, refer to the [docs](https://github.com/adebola-io/whirlwind/tree/master/docs) folder.

## Features ‚ú®

- First Class Functions.
- Static, Nominal Typing System.
- Support for Generic Programming.
- Support for Union Types.
- Inbuilt Testing capabilities.
- Modular organization.

## Syntax üìê

Whirlwind is inspired heavily by the syntax of already existing languages. An example of Whirlwind code is:

```ts
/// Function to add two numbers.
function add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
   return a + b
}

/// Entry to the program.
function main() {
   add(2, 3)
}
```

## Roadmap and Implementation Status üõ†Ô∏è
