<h1 align=center>Whirl ðŸŒª</h1>

Whirl is (going to be) a general purpose multi-paradigm programming language that allows you to quickly and easily write maintenable software.

## Getting Started

## Syntax
Whirl is inspired heavily by the syntax of languages like Rust and Typescript. An example of Whirl code would be:

```wrl
public function Add(a: Integer, b: Integer) {
  a + b
}

public function Main() {
  c := Add(2, 3);
  Core.Fmt.Print(c);
}
```
